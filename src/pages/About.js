        <u>An Evolving Landscape</u>
      </h5>
      <p>
        Electronic Health Records (EHR's) have risen in popularity in the last
        10-15 years as professionals in medical, behavioral health, addiction
        treatment, and other fields have been under increasing pressure to
        modernize documentation standards while continuing to provide quality
        services to their clients. Several recent legislative measures have
        increased regulatory pressure, so the need for quality information
        systems has also increased. Providers have long been drowning in
        paperwork and unfortunately the swell of information needed to be
        collected and transmitted in these lines of work is only increasing.
      </p>
      <h5>
        <u>Reimagining the EHR</u>
      </h5>
      <p>
        EHR solutions unfortunately have not kept up with the rising tide of
        documentation needs, and that's where <b>Advcte</b> comes in. Just like
        hard-working service providers <i>advocate</i> for the needs of
        vulnerable children, families, and all patients alike: Advcte is here to
        finally meet the needs of service providers.

        The are plenty of system out there that were on the forefront of
        innovative technology at the dawn of electronic health records, but many
        of these systems are now outdated. Some are built to <i>still</i> run
        only on Internet Explorer 11 and other aging internet standards, which
        makes the user experience generally terrible. And on top of that, most
        solutions don't work with mobile platforms that well, or offer mobile
        versions separately (for an additional cost).
      </p>
      <p>
        Advcte is primarily built with <b>JavaScript/ECMAScript 2018</b>, Meta's{" "}
        <b>React</b> JavaScript library, and <b>Bootstrap 5 (with Popper)</b> -
        a front-end design framework. The result is a fast, responsive user
        experience that provides a clean and easy-to-use interface. Plus, Advcte
        works on mobile devices (even your smartphone) out of the box. No
        additional costs or hidden fees.
